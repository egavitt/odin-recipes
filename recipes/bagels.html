<h2>Bagels!</h2>
<h5>Picture sourced from www.thedailymeal.com, recipe from www.kingarthurbaking.com</h5>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>9g instant yeast</li>
    <li> 480g bread flour</li>
    <li>12g salt</li>
    <li>14g non-diastatic malt powder (sub with brown sugar if you can't find it)</li>
    <li>303g warmm water</li>
    <li>2 quarts water</li>
    <li>28g non-diastatic malt powder or brown sugar</li>
    <li>14g sugar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine yeast, flour, salt, 14g malt powder/brown sugar, and 303g water and knead for about 10-15 minutes</li>
    <li>Place mixed dough in a greased bowl and set aside to rise, at least 1 hour</li>
    <li>Cut dough into 6-8 balls depending on your preferred bagel size (I go with 6)</li>
    <li>Form balls into bagel shape by slightly flattening, then poking a hole in the middle and roll with two fingers, place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and cover, let rise for another hour or so</li>
    <li>In the meantime, combine the 2 quarts water, 28g malt powder/brown sugar, and 14g sugar into a large pot, bring to a boil, also preheat oven to 425</li>
    <li>When water is boiling and bagels have risen, boil bagels in large pot, should be quick, about 1-2 minutes then flip, another 1-2 minutes and then take out. Bagels should be slightly inflated and sort of slimy</li>
    <li>Cover bagels in whatever toppings you like (I like everything bagels so I make my own mixture but go nuts here)</li>
    <li>Bake bagels in oven for about 22 minutes or so</li>
</ol>
