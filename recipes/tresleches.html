<h2>Gluten Free Tres Leches</h2>
<h5>FYI: I sourced this from mamaknowsglutenfree.com, photo as well. No pics of 
    one I've made but I can guarantee this is the best GF cake you can make. 
    My girlfriend has celiac so I make this often and it's a hit!</h5>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup gluten free flour, I use Red Mill 1-to-1</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>5 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar, separate into 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup</li>
    <li>1/3 cup milk, I use Lactaid milk because my girlfriend is also lactose intolerant</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>12oz can of evaporated milk</li>
    <li>14oz can sweet condensed milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup whole milk (again, Lactaid)</li>
    <li>Optional toppings like cinnamon, strawberries, cherries or other fruit</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
    <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in one bowl</li>
    <li>separate eggs and yolks into different bowls</li>
    <li>In another bowl mix 3/4 cup sugar and egg yolks, using a mixer is easier, they'll be pale yellow</li>
    <li>add 1/3 cup milk and vanilla extract to yolk mixture and mix on low</li>
    <li>Combine the yolk mixture with the flour mixture and mix gently (or on low in a mixer)</li>
    <li>In another bowl, beat egg whites on high, slowly add the 1/4 sugar (do it bit by bit) until you get stiff peaks, should look like whipped cream</li>
    <li>Slowly combine egg white mixture into the batter, do this gently as the whites make the cake fluffy, but make sure everything is incorporated</li> 
    <li>Pour batter into a greased 9x13 pan, smooth the top</li>
    <li>Bake cake for about 35 mins, try the toothpick test when done (insert toothpick in the center and if batter sticks to toothpick, give the cake another 2 minutes in the oven)</li> 
    <li>Poke a ton of holes in the cake</li> 
    <li>In a bowl, combine the evaporated, condensed, and remaining whole milk, then pour over cake slowly, make sure not to spill</li>
    <li>Refrigerate cake for at least an hour, trust me, it's way better cold</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in another bowl, mix heavy cream, powdered sugar, and remaining vanilla and mix on high to make whipped cream</li>
    <li>When cake is refrigerated, spread whipped cream on top of the cake, add desired toppings. Enjoy!</li>
